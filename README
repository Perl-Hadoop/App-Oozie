This is a tooling around the Oozie workflow scheduler for Hadoop.
It can deploy, schedule and re-run jobs. It is opinionated on
many things and also makes use of the Template Toolkit, so that
there is a powerfult tempalting mechanism for you to use when
creating complex definitions.

Running the application will need a `kinit` on secure clusters
before hand to have a Kerberos ticket, which will be propagated
to the Hadoop/Oozie services.

There might be some sections being out of date or not cleaned up
in this release.
